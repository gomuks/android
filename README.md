# gomuks android
A GeckoView wrapper app for gomuks web that adds push notifications and other
native integrations.

See the [gomuks docs](https://docs.mau.fi/gomuks/installation.html) for links
to APKs in the CI and installation instructions. Note that this does not
currently include a bundled backend, so the backend has to be hosted elsewhere.
